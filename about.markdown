Iâ€™m a software engineer specializing in observability, performance, and reliability, currently [working](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josefernandezmn/) at Netflix on the Compute team. I have a deep passion for systems and low-level languages, with a current focus on Rust and eBPF technology. I've contributed to the [Linux kernel](/linux-kernel/) and created [bpftop](/bpftop/).
